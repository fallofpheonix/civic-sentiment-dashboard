# Motive

## Why This Project Exists
- Convert unstructured civic discourse into operationally useful signals.
- Provide geographic visibility of emotional trends, not just aggregate sentiment.
- Support proactive civic response with risk-oriented indicators.

## Problem Statement
Stakeholders need fast, locality-aware interpretation of public mood across policy areas. Raw social/news streams are noisy and difficult to operationalize without aggregation, scoring, and visualization.

## Success Criteria
- Detect sentiment and emotion shifts by region/topic.
- Surface high-risk signals early enough for intervention.
- Offer interpretable dashboards for non-ML operators.
