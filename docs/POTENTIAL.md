## Strategic Potential
- City-level early warning signals for sentiment deterioration.
- Policy feedback loop: pre/post initiative impact tracking.
- Public communication optimization by topic and region.

## Commercial Potential
- SaaS dashboard for municipalities and NGOs.
- Data API subscription for civic analytics consumers.
- White-label deployments for consulting/public-sector programs.

## Research Potential
- Urban sentiment dynamics research dataset.
- Cross-source alignment studies (social vs news narratives).
- Risk-signaling benchmarks for civic distress classification.

## Constraint
Potential is currently limited by mock-heavy data paths, heuristic models, and monolithic architecture.
